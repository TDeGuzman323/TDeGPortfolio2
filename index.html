        My name is Tara DeGuzman.
        I am the oldest of three children and the only girl. I was born in May of 1988. My father is Claro Jose and mother is Maria Teresita.
        I have two younger brothers, Francis and Timothy. I grew up in Southern California in Porter Ranch.
        I developed a passion for music very early on in life. I started to sing at the age of 7 and competed in my first
        talent show that same year. As I got older, so did my taste in music - from Disney songs to Broadway. I fell in love
        with shows like "Miss Saigon" and "Les Miserables". It is because of this passion, I later on decided to move to
        New York City to pursue a career on the Broadway stage. I have gone on to perform in various well known shows throughout 
        the years. In addition to the stage, I have developed another passion, for God. I do my best to give my gifts back up to Him, every day.
        Also, I am part of the music ministry at Saint James the Worker in Redondo Beach. I sing and offer up my gift back up to Him.
        My biggest goal is to use my gifts to inspire miracles every day. </p>
